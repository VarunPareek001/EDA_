Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis.
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cardiotocography dataset. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data that may inform healthcare professionals about the condition of fetal health.
Key Steps:-
1) Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and content. This includes checking data types, non-null counts, and statistical summaries.
2) Data Cleaning: The dataset is checked for missing values, outliers, and other anomalies. Appropriate techniques, such as imputation or removal, are applied to clean the data.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                  a) Statistical Summaries: Descriptive statistics are calculated for each feature, giving insights into the distribution, central tendencies, and variability of the data.
                  b) Data Visualization: Various plots, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, are used to visualize the distributions and relationships between features.
                  c) Correlation Analysis: Correlations between different variables are examined to identify any strong linear relationships.
4) Conclusion: The EDA concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting any significant patterns or insights that emerged from the analysis.
